# Introduction

HeadBoard is a a secure social networking web application where software engineers can create posts about their favorite code, algorithms and career aspirations. I built this fully-functional project with Python and Flask. HeadBoard requires users to create an account with a GitHub or Stackoverflow account, and their email address. Their passwords are encrypted and stored in a local MySQL database. Once registered, users can login and create posts. Users are allowed to update, view and delete their posts, which are displayed by date and time in a dashboard.
